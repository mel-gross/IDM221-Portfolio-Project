        My name is Mel and I am a 20 year old artist living in Philadelphia and currently studying Interactive Digital Media at Drexel University. I am passionate about creating things, drawing and painting. I also like doing graphic design such as logos and website development, and I am eager to learn more about animation, video game design and programming.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I was born and raised in Brazil until I was 15 years old, and I went to high school in the Boston area. Throughout my academic life I took classes in many different artistic areas from traditional figure drawing to robotics. Due of my diverse cultural and academic background my creations are very unique and meaningful. 
      </p>

        For me the most inspiring thing is to help people. It is great to complete a project for someone and to see that I  helped them in some small or big way. I like making people's day better with my art, or solving someone's problem with my creative skills.
      </p>
      <p> 
        As I start my career path I will continue to learn as much as I can from as many sources as possible and apply these to my work. I want to continue creating and travelling as much as possible. Right now I am working with video production and project management of a YouTube channel for a painting studio called The Paint Bar and I am in the process of creating handmade planner's stickers to sell online.
